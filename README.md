# V-REP_simplus
This repository is dedicated to a Rescue simulation environment for Robocup Juniors and is aimed to be a bridge from Robocup Junior Rescue to Robocup Major Rescue competitions.

It is part of a project started in 2019 (in the CoSpace branch) which was designed to demonstrate the needs and posssibilities of such a bridge between the Junior Rescue Simulation and Virtual Robot competition. The project, under the tilte of "Filling the Gap between RCJ Cospace and Virtual Rescue Robot competition", was selected for funding by the RoboCup Federation for the season 2018/2019.

The reqiurments of a platform to be used for such a development are defined as follows:
* Being free and fully accessible to students to use,
* Ease of installation even on low-spec PCs,
* Interface that is intuitive to use.
* The ability to serve from fundamentals to higher complexity concepts,
* Easy transition to research-based platforms from educational-focused platform

After lots of investigations three platforms were selected: V-REP, Webot, and Gazebo. V-REP provides a free license for educational purposes and accepts seven programming languages. The scheme of developed environment for V-REP could be found in Wiki page, for which E-Puck robots were used. Using E-Puck enables students to face challenges in mobile size robots which has a great academic importance.
