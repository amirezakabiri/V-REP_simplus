# VRep Simulator

The robot simulator V-REP, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes V-REP very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.

* V-REP is used for fast algorithm development, factory automation simulations, fast prototyping and verification, robotics related education, remote monitoring, safety double-checking, etc.

* V-REP is cross-platform, and allows the creation of portable, scalable and easy maintainable content: a single portable file can contain a fully functional model (or scene), including control code.

# Powerfull V-REP APIs:
            Regular API: C & Lua
            Remote API: C, Java, Python, Matlab, Octave & Lua
            ROS &amp; BlueZero interface: publishers, subscribers &amp; service calls. Support all standard messages, extendable
